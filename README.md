## About
Creation of a robot for the Robocode real-time programming game.

This robot uses Wave Surfing which is a precise form of bullet avoidance movement used
If the robot detects a decrease in the enemy's energy, it knows that a bullet has been fired, and from that information it creates a corresponding wave
A wave consists of a shot's origin, a speed, the moment the wave was created and the direction to the target at the time of the shot
